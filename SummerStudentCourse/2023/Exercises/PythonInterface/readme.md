Welcome to the exercises of the **Python Interface** learning module!

## Histograms

In order to complete this exercise about ROOT histograms in PyROOT, please follow these steps:
- Open the Python interpreter.
- Import the ROOT module.
- Create a histogram with 64 bins and an x-axis ranging from 0 to 16.
- Fill it with random numbers distributed according to a linear function (*pol1*).
- Make the line width a bit larger.
- Draw it.

You can find the solution [here](HistoPol1.py).

## Graphs

In order to complete this exercise about ROOT histograms in PyROOT, please follow these steps:
- Create a new Python module.
- In the module, create a graph (*TGraph*).
- Set its title to *My graph*, its X axis title to *myX* and Y axis title to *myY*.
- Fill it with three points: (1,0), (2,3), (3,4).
- Set a red full square marker.
- Draw an orange line between points.

You can find the solution [here](Graph.py).

# C++ Interpreter Learning Module Exercises
Welcome to the exercises of the **C++ Interpreter** learning module!

## Start a ROOT session
Carry out these simple tasks:
 - Fire up ROOT
 - Verify it works as a calculator
 - List the files in /etc from within the ROOT prompt
 - Inspect the help
 - Quit

## Complete a simple ROOT macro
Consider the file *myMacro.C*. It is a simple ROOT macro. In this exercise, you
will fill in the code you interactively typed into the interpreter to verify the
value of the geometric series.
Run the macro with ROOT in three ways:
- Directly invoking ROOT as interpreter for it
- Executing it from within the prompt
- Loading it from the prompt and then invoking the *myMacro* function

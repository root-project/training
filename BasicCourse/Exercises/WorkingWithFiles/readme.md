# Working With Files Learning Module
Welcome to the exercises of the **Working with Files Learning Module**!

## Writing and Reading histograms
This exercise is entirely based on notebooks. You can click on the links above to open the notebooks in a SWAN session.
The instructions are embedded in the notebooks and your code soon will as well!

## TBrowser
Open the file with *root*
```root myFile.root```
And open a **TBrowser**
```root[0] TBrowser b```
Now display the histograms and fit them with the **FitPanel**: can you recover the distributions according to which you created the histograms?

// For more information on the TSelector framework see 
// $ROOTSYS/README/README.SELECTOR or the ROOT User Manual.

// The file for this selector can be found at
// http://lcg-heppkg.web.cern.ch/lcg-heppkg/ROOT/eventdata.root
// i.e run
//   root [0] f = TFile::Open("http://lcg-heppkg.web.cern.ch/lcg-heppkg/ROOT/eventdata.root");
//   root [1] EventTree->Process("EventSelector.C+")

// The following methods are defined in this file:
//    SlaveBegin():   called after Begin(), when on PROOF called only on the
//                    slave servers, a convenient place to create your histograms.
//    Process():      called for each event, in this function you decide what
//                    to read and fill your histograms.
//    Terminate():    called at the end of the loop on the tree,
//                    a convenient place to draw/fit your histograms.
//
// To use this file, try the following session on your Tree T:
//
// Root > T->Process("EventSelector.C")
// Root > T->Process("EventSelector.C","some options")
// Root > T->Process("EventSelector.C+")
